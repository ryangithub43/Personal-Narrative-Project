## Describe your project

This project alters the look of the various images and uses strings in the 2D arrays for text. It contains 4 images of different foods, and 4 strings of their respective images. Most of the methods within the program affect the Theatre class, changing the look of the current appearance. 

There are 3 classes: myStory.java, ImagePlus.java, Filter.java

myStory.java contains all the scene-changing methods. 
ImagePlus.java contains the written code that's needed to traverse the 2D array of an image.
Filter.java contains all the methods that change the appearance of an image. 

## What are you most proud of?

I'm most proud of being able to complete this project to the best of my abilities. The code that was needed in order for this to function was difficult to come up with.
